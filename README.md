# Vocal Local Support – E-Commerce Website

This is a simple **BCA project** website made using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The concept of the project is to support **local Indian sellers, artisans, and small businesses** under the theme **"Vocal for Local"**.

## Features

- Single-page responsive layout
- Product listing with:
  - Category filter
  - Price filter
  - Search bar
- Demo cart (cart item counter)
- About section
- Contact form (demo only)

## How to Run Locally

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make sure the file name is: `index.html`.
3. Double-click on `index.html` or open it in any browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

No server or backend is required. It is a purely static website.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (for example: `vocal-local-support`).
2. Upload the `index.html` file (and this `README.md` if you want).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** in your GitHub repository.
4. Under **Source**, select `main` or `master` branch and root folder, then click **Save**.
5. After a few minutes, your website will be live at:

   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ```

Example:

```text
https://rajabca.github.io/vocal-local-support/
```

(Replace `rajabca` and repository name with your own.)
